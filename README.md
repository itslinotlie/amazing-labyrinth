The first project of the ICS4U group project series. The goal of this project is to create a clone of the Labyrinth board game, *THE aMAZEing LABYRINTH*. Board games are known to have very descriptive explanations, but in short, the goal of this game is to collect your treasure(s) before others. Each turn, you can shift a row or column of tiles to strategically reposition yourself or hinder your opponent's movements, or do both at the same time (:
